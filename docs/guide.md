# OpenPlaceFinder User Guide

## Introduction

In this guide you'll learn how to use OpenPlaceFinder. Hopefully, you'll find most of the functionality pretty intuitive, based on previous knowledge from similar systems. However, we'll start with the basics, and try to present a bit of context and a few more advanced hints along the way.

OpenPlaceFinder is a web application, which can be used to locate places based on their type and geographical location. For instance, we could look for restaurants in the vicinity of our homes. If there are many such restaurants, we can narrow down the search using, for instance, the type of food they serve. This type of search is known as a *place search*, also known in mapping lingo as a point of interest (POI) search.

OpenPlaceFinder is based on [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org), which is an open geographic database powered by volunteers. In order to make queries to this data, we use the [Overpass API](https://overpass-api.de), which is a search engine for the OpenStreetMap database. You don't have to be familiar with these services, but it's nice to know that while you use this site it communicates with OpenStreetMap servers to download map tiles and query points of interest.

One feature inherited from OpenStreetMap is that we don't present reviews. For instance, in the case of restaurants, you can't search or sort based on a restaurant's average customer rating. This is based on OpenStreetMap's policy of not including subjective experiences into the database. Since this application is open source, we made the choice of not using data from separate review platforms which are mostly proprietary.
